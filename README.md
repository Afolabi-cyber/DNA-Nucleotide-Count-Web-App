# DNA Nucleotide Count Web App

This project is a simple DNA Nucleotide Count Web App built with Streamlit. The app takes a DNA sequence as input and provides the nucleotide composition (Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine) as output, both in text and graphical formats.

## Features
- **Input DNA sequence**: Paste or type a DNA sequence in the app.
- **Nucleotide count**: Get the count of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C).
- **DataFrame view**: Display the nucleotide counts in a tabular format using pandas DataFrame.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the nucleotide composition using an Altair bar chart.

## Installation

To run this app locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dna-nucleotide-count-app.git
